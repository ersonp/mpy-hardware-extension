"""LLM provider registry: DeepSeek (default) and OpenAI, selected by MPYHW_LLM_PROVIDER.

Both upstreams speak the OpenAI chat-completions protocol, so OpenAIProvider
subclasses DeepSeekProvider purely to reuse the shared request/stream code in
sse_translate; the class attributes below are the entire per-provider surface.
Moved out of sse_translate.py (which re-exports these names, as does routes_llm)
