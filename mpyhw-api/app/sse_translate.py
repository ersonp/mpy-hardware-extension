    # rejection is retried up to 5 times below, so that ceiling is ~50 minutes rather than the ~20
    # two attempts gave; the credit is refunded when the final UpstreamError raises. The client gives up sooner (undici's

    # Accepted because a real generate turn went silent for the full 300s and losing those is
