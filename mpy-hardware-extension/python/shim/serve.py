# PYLINT IS NOT HERE EITHER, and it is the one worth explaining, because it looks like the most
# natural member of a lint allowlist and was on this list until a review asked the right question.
# Pylint runs `init-hook`, arbitrary Python, before it analyses anything. It takes it from
# --init-hook, from --load-plugins, from --rcfile, and -- this is the part no argument guard can
# reach -- from a .pylintrc in the working directory. cwd is the project root, the model writes
# there, and the project is SUPPOSED to contain a pylintrc: ensure_pylintrc.py puts one there.
# Verified: a .pylintrc whose init-hook writes a file gets it written, with no flags at all.
#
# So allowing pylint here grants arbitrary code execution through a file rather than through a
# call, which is why blocking the flags was not enough and why this is a removal rather than a
# denylist. Lint still runs, through run_quality_gates.py, which is the path the contract wants
# and which the refusal message already names. Do not add it back without answering the .pylintrc
# question, since that is the door, not the flags.
#
# READ THIS BEFORE TREATING THE LINE ABOVE AS A BOUNDARY. Removing pylint closes one ROUTE to a
# capability the host already grants; it does not close the capability, and the sentence above
# reads as though it did. run_quality_gates.py -- the very path the refusal message sends the
# model to -- runs all three of these with cwd=project_dir, the tree the model writes:
#   * `-m pylint <targets> --rcfile=.pylintrc` (run_quality_gates.py:236) -- init-hook, and the
#     rcfile is named EXPLICITLY, so the file the model controls is loaded on purpose;
#   * `-m flake8 ... ` at cwd=project_dir (:224) -- flake8's own `[flake8:local-plugins]` section
#     imports a module by path from that config. Verified against flake8 7.3.0 with NO flags at
#     all: a `.flake8` declaring a local plugin executed the plugin's module-level code. `.flake8`
#     is not incidental either -- init_scaffold writes it on every render and the gate requires it;
#   * `-m unittest discover -s test/pc` (:253) -- runs project test code outright.
# So the honest boundary is: this shim executes project-controlled Python by design, and the
# module allowlist decides how many ways there are to ask for it, not whether it is possible.
# flake8 stays on the list for that reason -- dropping it would cost the model turns and close
# nothing -- and pylint stays off as one fewer route, not as a fix. Making this a real boundary is
# a question for the skills repository (a lint config the model cannot write, or a sandboxed gate
# run), not for this tuple.

# Measured: a model wrote tmp_debug_mock.py into the project to debug its own failing tests, was
# refused with "no bundled V0 plugin script named 'tmp_debug_mock.py'", and re-sent the identical
# call ten turns later. A refusal that names no route leaves guessing as the only move, and
# guessing costs turns against a 60-turn cap. The sibling branch below, ambiguous_script_name,
# already names its fix; this is the branch that did not.
#
# The ad-hoc-check line matters more than it looks: cwd is forced to the project root for a module
# run and cwd is on sys.path for `-m`, so `-m unittest <module>` ALREADY runs a file the model
# just wrote there. The door exists; the refusal simply never said where.
#
# Two example names, not the catalogue: a model needs the SHAPE of a valid call, and the full

# "Verification only" is a property of the MODULE list above, not of the arguments. Two of the

# `flake8 --output-file=PATH`. So an allowlisted, read-only-looking call can still overwrite any
# file the shim account can write, which is the one route through this dispatcher that escapes the
# containment `write_project_file` and `delete_project_path` enforce everywhere else.
#
# Guarding json.tool's output positional alone would leave the two flag spellings open, so the
# rule is on the ARGUMENTS and applies to every module: nothing that can name a path outside the
# project. Relative arguments cannot escape, because cwd is forced to project_dir a few lines
