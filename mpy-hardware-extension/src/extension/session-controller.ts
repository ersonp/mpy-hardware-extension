// Whether a manifest.wiring is a shape the webview buildComponents can render into
// cards. Whitelist (NOT mere presence) so a future plugin's non-renderable wiring —
// e.g. a format->path map { json: "docs/wiring.json", md: ... } — is treated as absent
// and the derived { buses, standalone } fills the tab instead of leaving it empty.
// buildComponents renders THREE shapes: a legacy flat [{ role, pin }] array, the
// { buses[], standalone[] } device-identity object, and the legacy bus-keyed
// { i2c: { sda, scl, devices } } object. The latter two are objects carrying a nested
// value; the path map has only string values, so it stays non-renderable and is derived
// over. Missing a shape here regresses the tab to empty the moment such a manifest lands.
