// FULL-STACK V0 e2e — the real product, including the plugin.
//
// Unlike mpyhw-api/scripts/e2e_protocol_v0.py (which drives the BACKEND internals in
// Python and runs scripts with its OWN faithful runner, bypassing the extension),
// this harness drives the SHIPPED extension path end to end:
//
//   real backend (/v1/llm/messages, real DeepSeek)
//     -> createProtocolLoop  (the exact factory SessionController/panel uses)
//        -> runProtocolBuild  (the real client loop)
//           -> real device-shim / serve.py  (runs the vendored V0 plugin scripts)
//           -> real project-file writer + reader  (host containment)
//
// So a fake-success script runner, a too-small per-phase turn budget, an old serve.py
// that can't resolve V0 plugin scripts, or a VSIX that doesn't bundle them all surface
// HERE as a failing run. This is the gate that "the whole product is on V0", not just
// the backend.
//
// Prereqs (same convention as run-live-gen.ts):
//   1. mpyhw-api running (mpyhw-api/scripts/serve.ps1) with DEEPSEEK_API_KEY set.
//   2. MPYHW_DEV_JWT = a dev session token signed with the backend's MPYHW_JWT_SECRET.
//   3. A Python on PATH; first run bootstraps ~/.mpyhw/venv.
// Bills several DeepSeek turns. Usage: npm run e2e:v0 -- "your intent here"

// collected, without touching the device.

// a PASS on a run whose deploy failed to open the port (terminal "failed"), and a REVIEW on
