// What the serial capture proves about the firmware the board actually ran.
//
// A boot line naming the build this run produced proves it ran. Output naming a DIFFERENT build
// proves a stale device: a deploy that fails before uploading leaves the previous firmware
// booting exactly like a success, and a DHT11 run was once reported "firmware ran: yes" on the
// strength of blink output left over from an earlier series.
//
// Between those two sits the case that cost a whole session. Firmware that RAISES before it can
// print its name leaves a traceback and nothing else, so the name can never appear -- and reading
// that absence as "a different build" turns our own crash into an accusation that the upload
// never landed. Measured: a Pico 2 blink run uploaded a main.py whose first log call died with
// TypeError, and the summary said "STALE DEVICE: nothing this run built reached the board" while
// the file on the device was byte-identical to the one just uploaded. The two readings send you
// at opposite bugs, so a crash has to be its own answer rather than a weak kind of foreign.
//
// That settles crashed-before-foreign. It does not settle ran-before-crashed: the owned check
// below runs first and, on a match, returns before the crash check ever sees the lines. Per-capture
// slicing makes that ordering easier to reach than it was before, because a marker in one capture
// used to be able to eat an earlier capture's owned line along with it -- the same bug this file
// exists to fix. With slicing per capture, an owned line in one capture reliably survives to
// outrank a genuine crash in a LATER one, so a run whose final boot crashed can still classify as
// `ran`. The final reset is by contract the LAST device operation, which is why it is the weak
// spot: there is no capture after it for the crash to be the only evidence in. This needs a crash
// that happens only on that later boot, not the one that already proved the build's name. A known
// consequence of the ordering, not an oversight in it.

// The backspaces have to be APPLIED, not merely dropped: the "^D" is literal text (bytes 5e 44),

 * half could carry a "ran" verdict. Left as-is because no producer on this path emits a bare \r
 * for in-place updates (MicroPython's REPL terminates with \r\n), and because the alternative
