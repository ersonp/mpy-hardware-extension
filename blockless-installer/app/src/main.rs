//! The Tauri shell over the core: mirrors `cli/src/main.rs::run()`'s wiring
//! for each op, forwards `core::progress::ProgressEvent`s to the window as
//! `progress` events, and emits one terminal `op-result` event per command.
//! No operation lives here that `core::ops` does not already implement --
//! this crate is wiring, the same way `cli/src/main.rs` is.
//!
//! Unlike the CLI (`cli/src/cli.rs` argument grammar vs `cli/src/main.rs`
//! dispatch), this crate is not split into an OS-gated and an OS-ungated
//! half: it inherently compiles only on macOS/Windows
//! (`blockless_installer_core::system::SystemEnvironment` is cfg-gated), and
//! is excluded from the root Cargo workspace precisely so nothing on Linux
//! ever tries to build it (see `../Cargo.toml`'s `exclude`).
//!
//! Layout: this file holds the process-wide state and the window loop;
//! `commands.rs` the three window commands; `manifest_lookup.rs` where the
//! sidecar manifest is searched for; `logging.rs` the per-write log file.

// Windows: link as a GUI binary, so launching the app does NOT also open a
// console window.
//
// Found on the Windows Sandbox rig, 2026-09-21. Without this, rustc links the
// msvc binary as a CONSOLE subsystem executable and Windows allocates a
// console for it on every launch: a black window titled
// `...\Blockless Installer\blockless-installer-gui.exe` that takes foreground
// focus and sits IN FRONT of the installer UI, for the whole session. On a
// one-click installer whose audience is a student opening the tool for the
// first time, that is the product's first impression.
//
// `not(debug_assertions)` scopes it to release builds, so `cargo run` during
// development keeps its terminal and its stdout.
//
// No gate can see this. The cargo gate never launches a window, and the macOS
// acceptance structurally cannot observe a Windows-only linker attribute --
// the same blind spot as the `VCRUNTIME140.dll` incident recorded in
// `../../.cargo/config.toml`, one layer further out.

/// `tauri.conf.json` asks NSIS to provision WebView2
/// (`webviewInstallMode: downloadBootstrapper`), but Tauri's NSIS template
/// decides whether to do so by reading a registry string:
///
/// ```nsis
/// ReadRegStr $4 HKLM "SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Clients\{F3017226-...}" "pv"
/// ${If} $4 == ""
///   ; ... every install mode lives in here
/// ```
///
/// Microsoft Edge registers that same client GUID. On a machine where Edge
/// has registered it but the WebView2 *runtime* was never installed -- a
/// stock Windows Sandbox image, and any machine like it -- the probe finds a
/// version string, concludes the runtime is present, and skips provisioning
/// entirely. The bundle installs in about a second and the app then has
/// nothing to render into.
///
/// **No `webviewInstallMode` value fixes this.** `downloadBootstrapper`,
/// `embedBootstrapper` and `offlineInstaller` are all nested INSIDE that same
/// `${If} $4 == ""`, so the probe short-circuits every one. Embedding the
/// runtime would not have helped; it would just have been skipped too. That
/// is why the check and the provisioning live here as well as in the bundle.
///
/// The bundle is still how this ships, and still asks NSIS to provision the
/// runtime: on a machine with a clean registry it does so and this pre-flight
/// is a no-op. This exists for the machine where the probe is wrong. (A
/// portable build with no bundle was tried and reverted -- `d783c91` -- because
/// nothing then points at the uninstaller.)
///
/// `fixedRuntime` is the one other `webviewInstallMode` that would avoid the
/// probe, by shipping a runtime alongside the app at roughly 180 MB. It
/// remains a live alternative to this module, not a discarded one.
///
/// `tauri::webview_version()` is the right oracle because it does not consult
/// the registry at all: wry calls Microsoft's own
/// `GetAvailableCoreWebView2BrowserVersionString`, which reports on the
