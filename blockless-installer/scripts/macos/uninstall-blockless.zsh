#      installer recorded creating it (state.json profileCreatedByUs), never a user's pre-existing
#      profile that merely shares the name
#   2. the contained runtime under ~/Library/Application Support/Blockless (uv, python, env,
#      downloads, logs, state.json)
# VS Code itself and its OTHER profiles are left untouched by default. VS Code is removed ONLY when
# the installer recorded that it installed it (state.json vscodeInstalledByUs) — never a user's
# pre-existing editor. --all forces removal, --keep-vscode prevents it. The shared VS Code user
# data (~/Library/Application Support/Code) is never touched. Requires VS Code to be closed.
#
# Doubles as the test reset: run this in the VM to get back to a clean slate without re-cloning
# (use --all for a true cold reset so a re-run exercises the VS Code install path again).
