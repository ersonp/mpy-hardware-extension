//! The "Blockless" VS Code profile: offline registration, resolving where it
//! really lives on disk, and the window-launch fallback with its teardown.
//! Ports `register_profile_offline`/`Register-ProfileOffline`,
//! `profile_registered`/`Test-ProfileRegistered`,
//! `resolve_profile_location`/`Get-ProfileLocation`, and
//! `register_profile`/`Register-Profile` + `stop_code_and_wait`/`Stop-OurCode`.
//!
//! The window-launch fallback resolves the real VS Code process the same way
//! M0's Windows script does (`Get-CodePids` before/after): `code_cli` is a
//! wrapper -- on mac a short shell script, on Windows a `.cmd` -- that hands
//! off to the real Electron process and may itself have already exited by
//! the time that process is up, so the PID `spawn()` returns is never used
//! for teardown. Instead: snapshot `running_vscode_pids()` before spawning,
//! spawn, poll for registration, then diff `running_vscode_pids()` again to
//! find whichever PID(s) newly appeared. Only those get torn down, and only
//! if nothing was already running before we spawned -- so a window the user
//! opened themselves is never touched. All process operations go through
//! [`CommandRunner`] so this is testable without a real VS Code binary or
//! real wall-clock waits.
