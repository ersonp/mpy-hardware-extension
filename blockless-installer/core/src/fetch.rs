//! Download + sha256 verify + retry/backoff + proxy (`/scope.md` §11 / ARCHITECTURE §11).
//!
//! Every artifact this installer fetches (VS Code, uv, the offline uv-managed
//! Python) goes through [`fetch_and_verify`]: retries cover transport failures
//! only (connection errors, timeouts, non-2xx status), matching M0's
//! `curl --retry 3` semantics; a completed download whose sha256 does not
//! match the manifest is a hard, non-retried failure -- retrying a
//! deterministic wrong-content response would not fix it, and silently
//! accepting it is exactly the class of bug this exists to prevent. The file
//! is only ever written to its final path atomically (temp file + rename in
//! the same directory), after the hash check passes, so a failed or
//! in-progress download can never be mistaken for a verified artifact.
//!
//! The `reqwest::blocking::Client` proxy detection is left at its default
//! (`Client::builder().build()`, never `.no_proxy()`), which honors
//! `HTTPS_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` from the environment automatically.
