#![cfg(any(target_os = "macos", target_os = "windows"))]
//! Rig-only: does the REAL `running_vscode_pids` see a REAL running VS Code?
//!
//! Every other test of this trait injects a fake. That is what makes the logic
//! testable, and it is exactly why the real macOS implementation was broken from
//! M0 onward without a single test noticing: it searched for
//! `.../Contents/MacOS/Electron`, which matches nothing, so it always returned
//! an empty vec and every guard keyed on it was inert. `uninstall` never refused
//! while VS Code was running, the profile seed never skipped, and the settings
//! writer's "never write while VS Code is running" rule never held -- around
//! `storage.json`, which holds every profile and window state the user has.
//!
//! Observed on a real macOS VM before the fix: uninstall removed the profile
//! with two VS Code windows open, and VS Code recreated it underneath.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because it needs a machine with VS Code installed AND running,
//! which no CI runner has. Run it on the acceptance rig, with VS Code open:
//!
//!     cargo test --test live_vscode_running -- --ignored --nocapture
